Terminology Annotation Showcase
===

The showcase allows you to automatically annotate terminology in ITS 2.0 enriched content in HTML5, XLIFF and plaintext.

The solution is organised into the following three logical projects:

* Tilde ITS - a reusable software library that implements the Internationalization Tag Set (ITS) Version 2.0

* Tilde TAWS API - a web service that annotates terminology in the submitted document

* Tilde TAWS Showcase - a user interface for TAWS in the form of a web site

For ease of deployment, the solution is organised into the following two physical projects:

* [Tilde.Its](Tilde.Its) - Tilde ITS

* [Tilde.Taws](Tilde.Taws) - Tilde TAWS API and Tilde TAWS Showcase
